            <h3>Data about me.</h3>
            <p>My name is Oscar Rojas. I'm 20 years old and from Venezuela. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering 
            at Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho University, where I'm in my 6th semester. Throughout my academic journey, I've worked 
            on various projects for university assignments.This portfolio serves as a way to showcase those projects and 
            preserve them over time as evidence of my growth and skills throughout my career. Feel free to explore all the 
            content in this portfolio.

            <h3>What Programming environment do you work in?</h3>
            <p>I have worked with multiple programming languages and environments, primarily in C++, PHP + HTML + CSS, 
            Pascal, as well as some Python and JavaScript. For my community service project, I used WordPress with 
            plugins such as Elementor and Yoast SEO. This portfolio was built using React + Vite, a framework that runs 
            on TypeScript (extended).
            <br></br>

            In addition, I have experience with SQL and expertise in designing relational databases, including creating and 
            managing tables with proper relationships in PostgreSQL and MySQL.
